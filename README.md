# Salad_Slitherer
(WIP)

## About:
The Salad-Slitherer is a unique salad bowl created for lizards that arenâ€™t fond of eating their greens. This innovative bowl features a simple mechanical system that facilitates movement, making it appear as though there are worms inside. The subtle motion entices lizards to consume more vegetables, offering an effective solution for encouraging healthier eating habits in these little reptiles.

## Progress:

 Summary:
_________________

 Design: 
 - The product's design process was extensive, involving multiple iterations. Almost all aspects of the design are finalized, except for potential adjustments during the prototyping phase.

CAD:
- CAD work for the product has begun but is susceptible to change as the electronic portion is put together.

Work to be complete:
- 3D printing and protoyping
- Setting up electronics

The design process encompassed many sketches. A full PDF of my sketches can be found [here](Salad_Slitherer_Sketches.pdf)

## CAD Models:
All SolidWork CAD models were created using SolidWorks 2023. All files for the assembly can be found in the repository.

## External Help (Parts that will be put to use):

The following parts and links are pieces that I plan to use in this project. I used their dimensions to help create my CADs.

(Will update as work progresses)
